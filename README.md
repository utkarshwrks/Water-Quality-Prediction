# ðŸ’§ Water Quality Prediction

This project predicts water quality using historical environmental data. It involves data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning techniques to analyze key water quality indicators such as pH, BOD, COD, and dissolved oxygen. The goal is to support environmental monitoring and decision-making through accurate predictive modeling.
